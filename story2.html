        <b><p>Tiger was picked as the National animal of India because of its elegance, strength, agility, and colossal power. On 1st April 1973, Government launched Project Tiger to save tigers. It was launched from the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand.
            A national animal is one of the emblematic representatives of a country’s natural wealth. The national animal is selected based on several criteria. The first one is how well it denotes certain features that a nation wants to be recognized with.
            The national animal should have a rich history as part of the nation’s heritage and culture. The national animal should be well distributed within the country. Mostly a national animal should be indigenous to that specific nation and elite to the country’s identity. The national animal is also taken based on the conservation status of the animal to allow better efforts towards its sustained survival due to the official status.</p></b>
        <p><b>The magnificent tiger, Panthera tigris is a striped animal. It has a thick yellow coat of fur with dark stripes. The combination of grace, strength, agility and enormous power has earned the tiger its pride of place as the national animal of India. Out of eight races of the species known, the Indian race, the Royal Bengal Tiger, is found throughout the country except in the north-western region and also in the neighbouring countries, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. To check the dwindling population of tigers in India, 'Project Tiger' was launched in April 1973. So far, 27 tiger reserves have been established in the country under this project, covering an area of 37,761 sq km.</b></p>
